# a-piBO

Companion demo notebook to the following paper:  [Link to paper available upon publication].


## Features

- We provide implementations for PBI, a-piBO and [piBO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11051).
- Users can experiment with various hyperparameter values, including alpha, beta, and the standard deviation of the prior for [Materials science datasets](https://github.com/PV-Lab/Benchmarking).
- We provide the data to reproduce figure A.15.

## Usage
We recommend using Google Colab to run the notebook for a seamless experience; simply click the provided link to get started.
